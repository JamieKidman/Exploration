# Exploration
Random Ideas, or an abstraction of something I'm working on so I can think clearly and boil an idea down further. Or things that I made that makes my life alot easier.

dict.py: Used as an abtraction so I can graph a data set easier. This doesnt include any graphing but a way of adding items to a dictionary with an initialised value, or if it already exists it'll add 1 to the value. doenst require any libaries or any other files.
